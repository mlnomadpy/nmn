            <p>
                We introduce ⵟ-Perceptron Layer, the Neural Matter Layer (NML), a breakthrough in neural network architecture that achieves non-linear pattern recognition without activation functions. Our key innovation, the 
                ⵟ-product and posi-ⵟ-product, naturally induces non-linearity by projecting inputs into a semi-metric space, eliminating the need for traditional activation functions while maintaining only a softmax layer for final class probability distribution. This approach simplifies network architecture and provides unprecedented transparency into the network's decision-making process.
                Our comprehensive empirical evaluation across different datasets demonstrates that ⵟ-MLP consistently outperforms traditional MLPs, both with and without activation functions. The results challenge the fundamental assumption that separate activation functions are necessary for effective deep-learning models. Beyond performance improvements, our method offers significant advantages in computational efficiency and model interpretability.
                The implications of this work extend beyond immediate architectural benefits: by eliminating intermediate activation functions while preserving non-linear capabilities, ⵟ-MLP establishes a new paradigm for neural network design that combines simplicity with effectiveness. Most importantly, our approach provides unprecedented insights into the traditionally opaque "black-box" nature of neural networks, offering a clearer understanding of how these models process and classify information.
